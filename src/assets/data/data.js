    description: "This coffee is what off-the-shelf brands are trying to emulate when they offer “100% Colombian” blends, and not one of them comes close to the quality of a fresh roasted Colombian Supremo bean. This classic artisan coffee is light roasted in small batches and displays a smooth yet complex body and a bright, sunny acidity. These large beans feature undertones of juicy lemons, brown sugar, and milk chocolate. If you are new to buying freshly roasted coffee and don’t know where to begin, or if you’re a veteran, this selection will satisfy your coffee craving!",

Hailing from the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Sumatran beans are very low in acidity and produce an aroma that ranges from maple syrup to chocolate to toasted almonds. A cup of this brew is smooth and full-bodied with a robust, dry finish with a distinct note of baker’s chocolate.",

    description: "On graduation day, after throwing your mortarboard into the air, you may have thought of the importance of letter grades as a thing of the past, but our Kenya AA beans prove otherwise. The AA designation is the highest grade on the scale and is based on the size, shape, and density of the beans, and after one cup, you’ll know why even an A+ wasn’t lofty enough for this coffee. Maturing in Kenya’s rich volcanic soil, these beans have a sharp, winey flavor with a distinct fruitiness that’s sure to excite the taste buds of even the most jaded coffee aficionado. The beans are roasted a bit darker than other Light coffees we offer (but not dark enough to be oily) to bring out the subtle flavor notes the normal Light roast will not. Try it, and find out why these beans are at the top of the class.",

    description: "In 850 AD, it is said an Ethiopian goat herder discovered the wonders of coffee when his flock grew restless and wouldn’t go to sleep at night. Curious, he discovered that his flock had been eating the cherries of coffee trees. This artisan coffee offers a smooth yet surprisingly deep body and crisp acidity. Displaying a sweet, chocolaty aroma and flavor notes reminiscent of buttery pecan and cocoa powder, these versatile gourmet coffee beans are great for drip coffeemakers, pour over, French press, percolator, and reusable K-Cups. Whether you are writing code or herding goats, you’ll know Yirgacheffe is the discovery of a lifetime.",
